Overview:
I made a memory game where you have to click two tiles and it will temporary display the 
background. If you click two of the same images they will disappear. You win if all the
images are gone at the end.


What was learned:
Learned a lot more about the DOM and the child/parent relationship between elements.
More on how to select each element and how to debug using the console throughout the
process. I found out the importance of planning out the design before coding right away. 
And the key to the main functionality being event.currentTarget which selects the exact
target that the user clicks on. Before that I didn't know how to select a target because
they had multiple class names and couldn't be replaced with an id. Main data structure 
I used was an array where I'd input the classname of the selected element. This took a lot
longer than I had hoped but I'm happy with the results. Probably could have made a few 
more comments throughout but I think it's pretty self explanatory at this point.


Improvements to be made:
Lots of improvements to be made but for now it is functional and looks okay. 
-Can't select more than 2 objects at a time
-They both timeout at the same time
-Dont remove the div, rather mark it as complete somehow
-Add more avengers 
-Giving the values absolute positioning
